Unit 12 | Assignment - Web Visualization Dashboard (Lattitude)
Background
Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Let's take what we've learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we've done.

Lattitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
For this homework we'll be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically, we'll be using the data from HW06.

In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

Website Requirements
For reference, see the "Screenshots" section below.

The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

A landing page containing:
An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page.
Four visualization pages, each with:
A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
A "Comparisons" page that:
Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
A "Data" page that:
Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
The table must be a bootstrap table component.
The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. You may use a csv-to-html table conversion tool, e.g. ConvertCSV.
